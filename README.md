## Project Goal
The mission of the **100-Hour AI Goal Coach** is to create a tool that helps people achieve their ambitions through gamification, accountability, and AI-driven support. It is designed to provide structure, motivation, and personalized guidance while remaining simple and enjoyable to use.

# Getting Started

This guide shows you how to set up and run **both** the React frontend and the Express backend for the AI Coaching App.

## 1)  Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codersam77/100HourAI.git
cd "100-Hour-AI"

```
## 2) Install Dependencies
### 2.1 Frontend (React)
```bash
cd Frontend        
npm install
```

### 2.2 Backend (Express)
```bash
cd ../Backend     
npm install
```

## 3) Running the Project
You’ll need two terminals—one for the React app and one for the Express server.

### 3.1 Start the React App
```bash
cd Frontend        
npm start
```
### 3.2 Start the Express Server
```bash
cd Backend        # open a new terminal first
node server.js
```

## 4) Testing the App
Confirm both servers are running.

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Interact with the UI—network calls should hit the backend on port 4000 (or the port in .env).

## 5) Project Flow
Layer	Responsibilities
React Frontend	UI, routing, user input
Express Backend	AI logic, habit & streak tracking, deposit handling
